Data frames and tibbles are R’s structures for storing tabular data; if you inherit a tabular dataset in R, it will almost certainly come as one of these structures.\nHere, you will learn how to do three things with data frames and tibbles:\n Look at the contents of a data frame or tibble Open a help page that describes a data frame or tibble Identify the variables and their types in a tibble  You will also meet the palmerpenguins and nycflights datasets. These datasets appear frequently in R examples.\nThe readings in this tutorial follow R for Data Science, sections 3.2 and 5.1.\nData frames What is a data frame? A data frame is a rectangular collection of values, usually organized so that variables appear in the columns and observations appear in rows.\nHere is an example: the penguins data frame contains observations collected and published by Dr. Kristen Gorman from Palmer Station, a long-term environmental research site in Antarctica. The data frame contains 344 rows and 8 columns. Each row represents a penguin, and each column represents a variable that describes the penguin. Each penguin is one of three different species.\n   Typing penguins into the R console prints the header of the penguins data frame.\n## # A tibble: 344 × 8 ## species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g ## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 Adelie Torgersen 39.1 18.7 181 3750 ## 2 Adelie Torgersen 39.5 17.4 186 3800 ## 3 Adelie Torgersen 40.3 18 195 3250 ## 4 Adelie Torgersen NA NA NA NA ## 5 Adelie Torgersen 36.7 19.3 193 3450 ## 6 Adelie Torgersen 39.3 20.6 190 3650 ## 7 Adelie Torgersen 38.9 17.8 181 3625 ## 8 Adelie Torgersen 39.2 19.6 195 4675 ## 9 Adelie Torgersen 34.1 18.1 193 3475 ## 10 Adelie Torgersen 42 20.2 190 4250 ## # ℹ 334 more rows ## # ℹ 2 more variables: sex \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;, year \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; A note about palmerpenguins The code above worked because I’ve already loaded the palmerpenguins package in this tutorial: penguins comes in the palmerpenguins package. If you would like to look at penguins on your own computer, you will need to first load palmerpenguins. You can do that in two steps:\n Run install.packages(\u0026#39;palmerpenguins\u0026#39;) to install palmerpenguins if you do not yet have it. Load the package with the library(palmerpenguins) command. Run the command data(package = \u0026#39;palmerpenguins\u0026#39;) to load the penguins data frame into your R session.  After that, you will be able to access any dataset contained in the palmerpenguins package—until you close R.\nOne thing to notice Did you notice how much information was inside penguins? Me too. Sometimes the contents of a data frame are hard to interpret. Let’s get some help with this…\nHelp pages How to open a help page You can learn more about penguins by opening its help page. The help page will explain where the palmerpenguins dataset comes from and what each variable in the penguins data frame describes. To open the help page, type ?penguins in the code chunk below and then click “Run Code”.\nThe ? syntax You can open a help page for any object that comes with R or with an R package. To open the help page, type a ? before the object’s name and then run the command, as you did with ?penguins. This technique works for functions, packages, and more. If you want to specify getting help for a function or dataset in a particular package, you can use the :: operator. For example, ?dplyr::filter will open the help page for the filter() function in the dplyr package.\nNotice that objects created by you or your colleagues will not have a help page (unless you make one).\nExercises Please answer the following questions.\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box} What does the bill_depth_mm variable of penguins describe?

This is the world of model-fitting.\nPerhaps we performed a study in which we counted the number of pollinator visits the flowers of a focal plant species received over a range of different plant densities and now wish to characterize the relationship between these variables. (To keep things simple, we’ll assume each plant has only a single flower.) Or perhaps we performed an experiment in which we varied the number of pollinator visits that the flowers of the plant species received and are now interested in characterizing how this variation in visits influenced ovule fertilization success (i.e. the proportion of ovules in each flower that were successfully fertilized).\nIn the past, the common way to characterize any such relationship among variables was to use linear or non-linear least-squares regression (including polynomial regression), extending more recently to mixed effects models. Generalized linear models and generalized additive models have also become popular, largely because they can accommodate non-Gaussian error structures and flexible, non-linear relationships.\nBut these types of statistical models are generally not “mechanistic”; their functional forms are not derived from “first-principles” ecological theory. Instead, these types of models are by and large only “descriptive” in nature.\nTheoreticians, on the other hand, have derived many non-statistical (deterministic) mathematical equations to encapsulate how different biological processes should/could influence the patterns we see in nature. Our goal is to develop the skills to (1) fit such mechanistic models to data in order to obtain best-fitting parameter estimates while accommodating process-appropriate error structures, and (2) compare the relative performance of several such models in order to identify those that perform best at representing the data.\nWe will achieve these things using the principle of maximum likelihood and an information-theoretic model-comparison approach. Other approaches for model fitting and comparison — such as Bayesian statistics — are often used to accommodate complex data structures and for other pragmatic and epistomological reasons, but those are beyond what we will cover. That said, most of the principles that we will cover are directly relevant to these other approaches as well.\nOverview To understand the principle of maximum likelihood, we first need to understand some fundamentals regarding probability distributions and likelihood functions. We’ll then see how theory models can be incorporated into likelihood functions to convert them from deterministic models to statistical models. It’s this conversion that permits us to fit them to data. We will then develop our intuition for maximum likelihood parameter estimation (i.e. model fitting) by first doing it analytically and then learning to use numerical optimization.\nHaving fit several models to a dataset, we will then dip our toes into the methods of comparing their relative performance using information criteria.\nSkip down to the end result to see where we’re headed.\nRequired R-packages In principle, everything we’ll discuss can be accomplished using functions that come pre-loaded in base R, but we’ll make use of the bbmle package for a few conveniences at the very end.\n# install.packages(\u0026#39;bbmle\u0026#39;, dependencies = TRUE) # use to install if needed library(bbmle) ## Loading required package: stats4 Fundamentals We’re going to start by assuming our focal response variable doesn’t vary in response to any possible covariates at all. Doing so is useful in helping us think about the different types of probability distributions there are, and which may be best in representing the type of stochastic processes that are likely to have generated our data.\nProbability distributions Our two example data sets above share some things in common because they both represent (or are derived from) counts of things. Counts are integer-valued (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, …) and can’t be negative. The proportion of fertilized ovules is derived from two counts: the count of fertilized ovules and the total count of available ovules. Count data are a very common type of data in ecology, so we’ll focus on them for our purposes.\nAmong the simplest and most appropriate probability distributions to represent such data are the Poisson and binomial probability distributions. Because they represent counts, they are discrete distributions.\nThe Poisson distribution The Poisson distribution would be appropriate for our dataset in which the count of visitations is our response variable. It is written as $$ Pr(k|\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$$ and expresses the probability that $k$ events will occur in some interval of time (i.e. that the count of …","date":1723593600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1723593600,"objectID":"ec2c5709147baed9ba2f496c320224e9","permalink":"https://models4data2theory.github.io/courses/wkshp_interactions/","publishdate":"2024-08-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/wkshp_interactions/","section":"courses","summary":"Fitting models to data\n","tags":null,"title":"Interactions","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://models4data2theory.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
