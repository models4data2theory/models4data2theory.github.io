There are almost infinite ways in which hundreds of species can possibly interact. Networks allow to determine the specific, non-random interaction structure that actually occur in nature of those almost infinite possibilities. These networks also allow the study of the interplay between structure and dynamics of complex systems of interacting species, shedding light on how this interplay influences system responses to perturbations.\nRequired R-packages # PACKAGE LIST: Packages \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#34;igraph\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tidyverse\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;knitr\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kableExtra\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;evaluate\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;webexercises\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;vegan\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bipartite\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;viridis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rmarkdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;gridGraphics\u0026#34;) # LOAD PACKAGES: lapply(Packages, library, character.only = TRUE) # SUPPRESS UNHELPFUL `dplyr` MESSAGES:  options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE) # SAVE PACKAGE WARNING MESSAGES # this saves messages associated with package loading; display at the end # `evaluate` package pkg.load.msgs = evaluate(lapply(Packages, library, character.only = T)) Terminology A network consists of nodes and edges, where nodes represent discrete entities like people, computers, cities, or species, and edges (or links) represent the connections between these entities. Networks can be weighted or unweighted, depending on whether the connections have associated values or not. In weighted networks, the edges have numerical values that indicate the strength or distance of the connection between nodes. In the case of plant-pollinator networks, that weight has traditionally been the number or fraction of visits or pollen transported.\nNetworks can also be directed or undirected. In directed networks, such as food webs, the connections between nodes have a specific direction, such as the flow of energy, indicating a one-way relationship. In undirected networks, such as mutualistic networks, the connections are bidirectional, showing a two-way relationship between nodes (i.e., reciprocal benefits). We will see later that the reciprocal benefits between plant and pollinator species can be decomposed into the mechanisms by which those benefits are provided, which can convert the bidirectional links between species into two unidirectional links (i.e., consumption of floral rewards and pollination services).\nNetworks can also be unipartite or bipartite. Unipartite networks such as food webs consist of a single set of nodes (species), where edges can connect any pair of nodes within that set (any species can potentially be eaten by others). On the other hand, nodes in bipartite networks are divided into two disjoint sets, such as plants and pollinators, and edges (representing which pollinator species visits which plant species) only connect nodes from different sets (e.g., plants cannot visit other plants).\nBelow, there is an illustration of a plant-pollinator system represented as a bipartite network, with three plant and three pollinator species.\nEcological networks can be represented in various ways including a graph (as shown in the image above) or a matrix. Being able to switch between graph (network) and matrix form is powerful for understanding the full suite of network metrics we will see later.\nExercise 1.1: Using the bipartite network graph above, draw the corresponding matrix for the network. Assume that matrix rows represent animal species while matrix columns represent plant species. In the matrix cells, use 1’s to indicate an interaction between that animal and plant species and 0’s or blanks to indicate no interaction between species.\nNetwork data This workshop is focused on the integration of empirical data and theory in pollination networks. An important first step toward that integration is to know how to take empirical data and convert them into the standardized matrix format that is used in most packages and functions. For mutualistic networks like plant-pollinator networks, as discussed above, that format is a bipartite matrix with plants as rows, pollinators as columns, and (typically) counts of interactions filling the matrix.\nTypically, empirical data collected on ecological networks take the form of an edge list. This is the case for pollination networks in particular. To collect pollination network data, we are typically observing a set of flowers. When a flower visitor (presumed pollinator) visits a plant, we would record on a data sheet or field notebook the identity of the plant species and the identity of the flower visitor species. (In the field, we might capture an insect pollinator for later identification, but the idea remains the same, that at some point we would have a data sheet with the identities of the plants and the pollinators).\nSimilarly, you could also have an edge list created through pollen DNA metabarcoding; while you might need to play around with the formatting a bit it is common to end up …","date":1724284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724284800,"objectID":"9c58dcff331002096637ac5345b42f5d","permalink":"https://models4data2theory.github.io/courses/wkshp_networks/","publishdate":"2024-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/wkshp_networks/","section":"courses","summary":"     Analysis of structure\n","tags":null,"title":"Networks","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Fitting models to data\n$$ \\newcommand{\\L}{\\mathcal{L}} $$\nMotivation A powerful approach to theory-data integration is the use of statistical methods that directly combine empirical data with the mechanistic models of theoretical ecology. This is the world of model-fitting.\nPerhaps we performed a study in which we counted the number of pollinator visits the flowers of a focal plant species received over a range of different plant densities and now wish to characterize the relationship between these variables. (To keep things simple, we’ll assume each plant has only a single flower.) Or perhaps we performed an experiment in which we varied the number of pollinator visits that the flowers of the plant species received and are now interested in characterizing how this variation in visits influenced ovule fertilization success (i.e. the proportion of ovules in each flower that were successfully fertilized).\nIn the past, the common way to characterize any such relationship among variables was to use linear or non-linear least-squares regression (including polynomial regression), extending more recently to mixed effects models. Generalized linear models and generalized additive models have also become popular, largely because they can accommodate non-Gaussian error structures and flexible, non-linear relationships.\nBut these types of statistical models are generally not “mechanistic”; their functional forms are not derived from “first-principles” ecological theory. Instead, these types of models are by and large only “descriptive” in nature.\nTheoreticians, on the other hand, have derived many non-statistical (deterministic) mathematical equations to encapsulate how different biological processes should/could influence the patterns we see in nature. Our goal is to develop the skills to (1) fit such mechanistic models to data in order to obtain best-fitting parameter estimates while accommodating process-appropriate error structures, and (2) compare the relative performance of several such models in order to identify those that perform best at representing the data.\nWe will achieve these things using the principle of maximum likelihood and an information-theoretic model-comparison approach. Other approaches for model fitting and comparison — such as Bayesian statistics — are often used to accommodate complex data structures and for other pragmatic and epistomological reasons, but those are beyond what we will cover. That said, most of the principles that we will cover are directly relevant to these other approaches as well.\nOverview To understand the principle of maximum likelihood, we first need to understand some fundamentals regarding probability distributions and likelihood functions. We’ll then see how theory models can be incorporated into likelihood functions to convert them from deterministic models to statistical models. It’s this conversion that permits us to fit them to data. We will then develop our intuition for maximum likelihood parameter estimation (i.e. model fitting) by first doing it analytically and then learning to use numerical optimization.\nHaving fit several models to a dataset, we will then dip our toes into the methods of comparing their relative performance using information criteria.\nSkip down to the end result to see where we’re headed.\nRequired R-packages In principle, everything we’ll discuss can be accomplished using functions that come pre-loaded in base R, but we’ll make use of the bbmle package for a few conveniences at the very end.\n# install.packages(\u0026#39;bbmle\u0026#39;, dependencies = TRUE) # use to install if needed library(bbmle) ## Loading required package: stats4 Fundamentals We’re going to start by assuming our focal response variable doesn’t vary in response to any possible covariates at all. Doing so is useful in helping us think about the different types of probability distributions there are, and which may be best in representing the type of stochastic processes that are likely to have generated our data.\nProbability distributions Our two example data sets above share some things in common because they both represent (or are derived from) counts of things. Counts are integer-valued (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, …) and can’t be negative. The proportion of fertilized ovules is derived from two counts: the count of fertilized ovules and the total count of available ovules. Count data are a very common type of data in ecology, so we’ll focus on them for our purposes.\nAmong the simplest and most appropriate probability distributions to represent such data are the Poisson and binomial probability distributions. Because they represent counts, they are discrete distributions.\nThe Poisson distribution The Poisson distribution would be appropriate for our dataset in which the count of visitations is our response variable. It is written as $$ Pr(k|\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} $$ and expresses the probability that $k$ events will occur in some interval of time (i.e. that the count of …","date":1724284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724284800,"objectID":"ec2c5709147baed9ba2f496c320224e9","permalink":"https://models4data2theory.github.io/courses/wkshp_interactions/","publishdate":"2024-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/wkshp_interactions/","section":"courses","summary":"Fitting models to data\n","tags":null,"title":"Interactions","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Dynamics and stability\nThroughout, we will use the symbol $N$ to represent population size, as it does in nearly all population models in ecology.\nFor a start preceding the introduction of exponential growth, see the Of Potential Interest page.\nRequired R-packages We’ll need the deSolve package to integrate our differential equations with respect to time.\n# install.packages(\u0026#39;deSolve\u0026#39;, dependencies = TRUE) # use to install if needed library(deSolve) Exponential growth We will take as our starting point the differential equation,\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN . $$ The left-hand-side of this equation is little more than a tangent slope: the change in population size given a change in time (i.e. how much the population size changes over a small amount of time).\nThe right hand size is a product of the population size $N$ (at any given instant in time) and $r$ is the intrinsic per capita growth rate. The intrinsic growth rate is nothing more than the difference between the rate at which the average individual gives birth, $b$, and the rate at which the average individual die, $d$. Together, they left and right-hand sizes of the equation represent the model of exponential growth.\nThe key to the exponential model is that the per capita birth and death rates (and thus $r$) are themselves independent of $N$. As a result, the population will growth if $r$ is net positive ($b \u0026gt; d$) and will exhibit exponential growth. Conversely, the population will shrink if $r$ is net negative ($b \u0026lt; d$) and will exhibit exponential decay.\nProjections To use the differential equation $\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN$ to project population sizes into the future we need to integrate the differential equation. Integrating from time $0$ to some time $T$ in the future, and assuming an initial population size at time zero of $N_0$, we get:\n$$ \\int_0^T \\frac{dN}{dt} dt = \\int_0^T r N dt \\implies N_T = N_0e^{rT}, $$ where $e$ is Euler’s number aka the base of the natural logarithm, which rounded to 5 digits is: 2.71828. (Think of Euler’s number $e$ as the anti-logarithm $ln$ or $log_e$, just like $2^x$ is the anti-logarithm of $log_2$.) Euler’s number is deeply rooted to multiplicative (exponential) processes.\nThe fact that an exponential shows up in the equation is why the modelis referred to as the model of exponential growth.\nIntegration Analytically integrating $\\frac{dN}{dt}$ to obtain a projection equation for the exponential model is relatively straightforward. Doing so is also possible for other models, such as the Logistic model that we will look at next. However, for most population dynamic models in ecology (especially multi-species models), analytical integration isn’t possible. So what we want to do is to develop a platform for modeling population dynamics that allows us to numerically solve integration problems (i.e. solve with calculations done by the computer rather than analytically), in a way that is extensible to much more complex problems. And to learn such approaches, it is definitely best to start with a simple model—and the extremely simple exponential growth model is perfect for this.\nThe tool we will work with is the ode() function of the deSolve package. deSolve implements multiple different numerical methods for solving ODEs (ordinary differential equations), which are the kinds of equations we will be working with in this workshop (equations that have $\\frac{dN}{dt}$ on the left-hand side). The deSolve package is very powerful and allows us to numerically solve even very complex multi-species network models (which we will be working up to throughout the day). But that flexibility means that it has a complex structure, which can admittedly be somewhat confusing when you are first starting to use it.\nThe function ode() requires a minimum of four input arguments, ode(y, times, func, parms):\n y is initial starting size of the variable (i.e. $N(0)$) times are the vector of time points $t$ at which we want ode to spit out the values of $N(t)$  e.g., times = 1:100 or times = seq(from = 1, to = 200, by = 0.2)   func is our ODE model for $dN/dt$ (written as a function with its own arguments) parms is a vector of the ODE model’s named parameters  The argument func (i.e. our ODE model) that we provide ode must be defined in a particular way that may feel a little redundant with the input that we pass to the ode function because they have to be working in parallel. The arguments that the function must have are (in order): (1) times; (2) the variable(s)—here, population size; and (3) the parameters used in our model.\nIn our code below, we will also take advantage of a facet of R that is not very well known. You can create a vector in R where you name the elements, for example my.vector = c(marmot = 3.2, pika = 47.6, ground.squirrel = 18.4). With a named vector, you can then access the elements via their name indicated with quotation marks: for the example above if you entered my.vector[\u0026#39;pika\u0026#39;] you would get back 47.6.

Given the parameter(s) $\\theta$, each integer value of an outcome $O$ (i.e. the discrete random variable) has some probability (some “mass”) of occurring.\nIn contrast, for continuous probability distributions, we instead refer to probability density functions, $f(O | \\theta)$. That’s because the probability of any specific value of a continuous random variable is zero! Instead, there is only a non-zero probability of the random variable falling within some interval of values. The higher the probability density over that interval, the higher the probability of observing a measurable value from within it.\nLikelihood functions The distinction between probability mass functions and probability density functions is relevant to the likelihood functions for discrete and continuous random variables. For discrete variables (as we will focus on in class), the likelihood of the parameter(s) given the data is equal to the probability of the data given the parameter(s), $$ L(\\theta | O) = P(O | \\theta). $$ For continuous variables, we maximize the likelihood of the parameter given the data by finding the parameter that maximizes the probability density function. That is, we maximize $$ L(\\theta | O) = f(O | \\theta). $$\nAnalytical MLE for Poisson Given $n$ observations (counts) from a process presumed to be well-described by the Poisson, we have that $$ -\\ln \\L(\\lambda |k) = -\\sum_i^n \\ln \\left (\\frac{\\lambda^{k_i} e^{-\\lambda}}{k_i!} \\right) . $$ Remembering that logarithms transform multiplicative processes into additive processes, we can write this as $$ -\\ln \\L(\\lambda |k) = -\\sum_i^n \\left ( \\ln ( \\lambda^{k_i} ) + \\ln (e^{-\\lambda} ) - \\ln (k_i!) \\right). $$ Since $\\ln x^y = y \\ln x$ and $\\ln e^x = x$, we can simplify this to $$ -\\ln \\L(\\lambda |k) = -\\sum_i^n \\left ( k_i \\ln (\\lambda) -\\lambda - \\ln (k_i!) \\right). $$ Distributing the summation, we get $$ -\\ln \\L(\\lambda |k) = -\\sum_i^n \\left ( k_i \\ln \\lambda \\right) + n\\lambda + \\sum_i^n \\ln (k_i!). $$ Now take the derivative with respect to $\\lambda$, set it equal to zero, and solve for $\\lambda$: $$ \\frac{d -\\ln \\L(\\lambda | k)}{d \\lambda} = - \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_i^n k_i + n = 0 \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{\\sum_i^n k_i}{n}, $$ which is the mean value of all the $k_i$ counts!\nOur analytically-solved maximum likelihood estimator for $\\lambda$, which we will symbolize by $\\hat{\\lambda}$, is therefore $$ \\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\sum_i^n k_i}{n}. $$ This is nothing more than a function, think $\\hat{\\lambda}(k,n)$, to which we provide a vector of observed $k$ counts and their $n$ number (the vector’s length) as inputs.\nDynamics Building exponential growth Population models are focused on rates of births and deaths.\nLet’s start out by considering a “closed” population, with no immigration or emigration.\nWe will set $B$ = births and $D$ = deaths; right now these are terms for the entire population, overall how many births happened and how many deaths happened?\nA simple population growth model can be formulated by stating the obvious, starting out with the number of individuals in a population at a defined time that we will call $t$: in the next time period of interest $(t+1)$—for example, one year later—the population size $(N_{t+1})$ will be the current population size $(N_t)$ plus the births $(B)$ that occur between time $t$ and time $t+1$, minus the deaths $(D)$ that occur in that time period.\nWe can write this model formally as $$ N_{t+1} = N_t + B - D. $$\nThus, if you know the estimated birth and death rates in the coming time period, as well as the current population size, it is easy to calculate what the population size will be for the next time point.\nThe equation above is what we might call a difference equation: the difference between the population size of our target species at two discrete points in time. For many species, especially those with highly seasonal life cycles like annual plants, it makes sense to model them in discrete time.\nAt the same time, for species with overlapping generations, especially those that don’t have seasonal reproductive patterns, it makes sense instead to model them in continuous time. It is also mathematically much more tractable to use continuous-time models. For the rest of our discussion of population dynamics, we will focus on continuous-time models.\nIn thinking about continuous-time models, we move from difference equations like the one presented above to differential equations that are focused on on the change in population size over some continuous swath of time. Calculus is well-suited for this and from here on out, we will use calculus notation to think about the differential equations involved in how population size changes over time, designated as: $\\frac{dN}{dt}$.
